 A numeronym is a number-based word.

 Most commonly, a numeronym is a word where a number is used to form an
 abbreviation  (albeit not an acronym or an initialism). Pronouncing the
 letters and numbers may sound similar to the full word: "K9" for "canine"
 (phonetically: "kay" + "nine"). A similar example in French is "K7" for
 "cassette" (phonetically: "ka" + "sept").

 Alternatively, the letters between the first and last are replaced by a
 number representing the number of letters omitted, such as "i18n" for
 "internationalization". Sometimes the last letter will also be counted
 and omitted.

 According to Tex Texin, the first numeronym of this kind was "S12n", the
 electronic mail account name given to DEC employee Jan Scherpenhuizen by
 a system administrator because his surname was too long to be an account
 name. Colleagues who found Jan's name unpronounceable often referred to
 him verbally as "S12n". The use of such numeronyms became part of DEC
 corporate culture.
